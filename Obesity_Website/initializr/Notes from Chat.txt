you need to make the input form!
:)
we'll walk through jquery to start off with
when creating the form, really think about how the js will hook into it
for example, each form element should have an ID for the js to access
and you should use classes for the css access points
the idea is to structure the html in a way that makes sense
look at bootstrap's horizontal form
they have a great demo
you need 2 inputs: weight, miles driven
so both will look something like:
<input id="weight" class="weight" value="180" ... />
js uses the id field to get data from the form
we'll do that later
css uses class fields
.weight { color: red
}
the idea is to structure the form well, so that its easy to interact with
the way to think about it is not in terms of js / css / html
but in terms of an ideal structure
I want a weight/driving calculator
it has the 'calculator' wrapper
with a 'caculator-weight' and calcualtor-driving components
I prepent 'calculator' for namespacing issues in js / css
so everyting in the module is caculator-...
ie class="calculator-weight"
